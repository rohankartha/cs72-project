Its base is currently in Shefford, a small town 90 minutes north of London, but the plan is for the museum to move inside the tunnels officially.In 1949, the tunnels’ era as a communications hub began. They were taken over by the General Post Office, which at that time was responsible for telephones as well as the postal system.The space was expanded with a series of “avenues” leading off the main streets, making this a unique underground environment — and this expansion would also open up the route for London Tunnels one day securing planning approval, explains Murray.Related article

It’s a time capsule of late 20th-century beige office fixtures, with a surrealist element added by one long room filled with doors that lead nowhere other than the bare tunnel behind.The centerpiece of the space is the bar, which is set to be reborn on a grand scale, with renderings showing a warmly glowing curved space making the most of the tunnels’ unique design.There should be capacity for a couple of hundred thirsty punters taking a break between areas to refuel and record the moment for social media.Murray hopes that the glitzed-up tunnels will eventually pull in three million visitors a year, with the Arts and Culture section a key part of the appeal for repeat visitors.While some parts of the London Tunnels maze will be retained as a cornucopia of fascinating obsolete thingamajigs, others are a huge blank canvas.These will be used for rotating art exhibitions, interactive structures and spectacular immersive displays using digital screens, projectors, scent-emitting technology and pinpoint speakers.Related article
