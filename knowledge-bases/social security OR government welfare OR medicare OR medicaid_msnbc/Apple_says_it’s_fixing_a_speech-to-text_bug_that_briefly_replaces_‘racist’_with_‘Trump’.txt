However, John Burkey, a former employee on Apple’s Siri team who now runs an AI startup, told The New York Times the glitch might not have been a coincidence.“This smells like a serious prank,” Burkey said. “The only question is: Did someone slip this into the data or slip into the code?”Allegations of racism have dogged President Donald Trump since before he entered politics. His anti-immigrant platform and his remarks over the years about nonwhite groups and individuals have further propelled those claims. Yet those accusations have done little, if anything, to loosen his iron grip on the Republican Party; Trump even managed to expand his appeal among nonwhite voters in the 2024 election.Since taking office, Trump has launched an aggressive campaign to erase diversity, equity and inclusion efforts across the federal government and in the private sector. And many tech companies have made moves to conform to the administration’s anti-DEI efforts by rolling back their own diversity programs and roles.On Tuesday, Apple shareholders, by contrast, voted against cutting diversity measures, leading Trump to speak publicly against that decision. “APPLE SHOULD GET RID OF DEI RULES, NOT JUST MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THEM,” he posted on Truth Social on Wednesday.Clarissa-Jan Lim is a breaking/trending news blogger for MSNBC Digital.
