He proposed everything from a "golden visa" for the wealthy to a cryptocurrency reserve, but for now they remain just proposals.Here’s a mostly complete look at what the Trump administration has done over the last seven days:• Passed a House budget on party lines that could cut Medicaid and food stamps to help pay for tax cuts for the wealthy.• Imposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada that went into effect on Tuesday.• Scrambled to rehire staffers with the Food & Drug Administration who monitor the safety of medical devices.• Proposed a "gold card" visa that would allow people to become lawful permanent residents for $5 million.• Criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to his face in a shockingly contentious White House meeting.• Slashed staff of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, fulfilling a Project 2025 goal.• Announced the White House would take control of a press pool run by journalists for more than a century.• Announced that it would strip security clearances from a white-shoe law firm for working with former special counsel Jack Smith.• Announced that the Treasury Department will no longer enforce an anti-money laundering law.• Began planning a nationwide operation to potentially deport children who came into the U.S. without a parent or guardian.• Proposed that the U.S. government purchase and hold cryptocurrencies in a "Crypto Strategic Reserve."• Said, through the Health and Human Services secretary, that measles deaths are "not unusual," though the U.S. hasn't had one since 2015.• Wrote an unusual op-ed for Fox News in which the HHS secretary said the measles vaccine should be "readily accessible for all those who want them."• Reportedly moved to cancel a $2.4 billion contract with Verizon to overhaul air traffic control systems and give it to Musk’s Starlink.• Made plans for large-scale layoffs at federal agencies in March and April in a memo calling the federal workforce "bloated" and "corrupt."• Floated a plan to put tariffs on copper as part of a move to hurt China's growth in the sector.• Threatened to put 25% tariffs on the European Union, claiming, inaccurately, that the economic bloc was formed "to screw" the U.S.• Filed three bills to impeach judges who ruled against the Trump administration in recent weeks.• Invited billionaire federal contractor Elon Musk to Trump’s first Cabinet meeting, although he is not a member of the Cabinet.• Said at that Cabinet meeting that the country has "gotten bloated and fat and disgusting."• Denied access to The Associated Press, Reuters, HuffPost and a German newspaper at the Cabinet meeting.• Revealed, after refusing to answer for weeks, that federal worker Amy Gleason is nominally the head of the DOGE effort.• Floated removing government spending from gross domestic product (GDP) reports, complicating any analysis of DOGE cuts.• Floated a controversial budget maneuver that would let Congress say that Trump's tax cut bill cost nothing, instead of trillions.• Posted a video on Truth Social that showed the Gaza Strip as a resort featuring gold statues of Trump.• Threatened to sue journalists who use anonymous sources or off-the-record quotes in news articles and books.• Blamed, without evidence, "paid 'troublemakers'" for Republican lawmakers facing tough questions at town hall meetings.Subscribe to Trump’s First 100 Days newsletter for weekly updates on and expert insight into the key issues and figures defining his second term.Ryan Teague Beckwith is a newsletter editor for MSNBC.
