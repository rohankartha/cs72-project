The Hamas terrorist organization on Thursday released the remains of four Israeli hostages it murdered following the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.The bodies handed over in a ghoulish Gaza ceremony were said to be of Shiri Bibas and her two children, Ariel and Kfir, as well as Oded Lifshitz, who was 83 when he was snatched.The remains were in black coffins and as a final insult, the caskets were locked and presented without a key — offered only after they were paraded before a delirious crowd across the streets of Gaza, according to the NY Post.Kfir, who was nine months old when he was taken, was the youngest captive.Hamas alleged all four were killed along with their guards in Israeli airstrikes but offered no evidence to support the claim.It is the first time the group Hamas has returned captives dead since the ceasefire began last month, with Israel saying it will confirm their identities after forensic examinations.“Our hearts — the hearts of an entire nation — lie in tatters,” Israeli President Isaac Herzog said in a statement.“On behalf of the State of Israel, I bow my head and ask for forgiveness. Forgiveness for not protecting you on that terrible day. Forgiveness for not bringing you home safely.”AP reports the terrorists displayed the four black coffins on a stage in the Gaza Strip surrounded by banners, including a large one depicting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a vampire.Bodies of the Bibas family and Oded Lifshitz are handed over to the Red Cross under a Gaza prisoner-hostage swap agreement in Khan Yunis, Gaza on February 20, 2025. Ahead of the handover, Hamas ghoulishly placed four black caskets on a stage behind which a banner was displayed depicting Netanyahu as Dracula, the infamous vampire, positioned above images of the deceased.
